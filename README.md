# About the Project

Everything runs on the Python standard library. There are no dependencies to install.

## The application

`calculator.py` is an interactive menu loop. You pick an operation, enter one or two numbers, and it prints the result rounded to two decimals. The last five results are kept in a bounded history.

Menu keys: `1`–`7` for the operations, `h` for history, `q` to quit.

### Operations

| Key | Operation                  | Input          | Rejected input                                                                     |
| --- | -------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1` | Add                        | two numbers    | —                                                                                  |
| `2` | Subtract                   | two numbers    | —                                                                                  |
| `3` | Multiply                   | two numbers    | —                                                                                  |
| `4` | Divide                     | two numbers    | a divisor of zero                                                                  |
| `5` | Power                      | base, exponent | zero base with a negative exponent; an exponent above 100; a result that overflows |
| `6` | Square root                | one number     | a negative number                                                                  |
| `7` | Percentage                 | value, percent | a negative percent                                                                 |
| `h` | Show the last five results | —              | —                                                                                  |
| `q` | Quit                       | —              | —                                                                                  |

Rejected input prints an error and returns to the menu; nothing is added to the history. An empty entry at a number prompt is rejected the same way.

## AI configuration

Three files steer an AI assistant working in this repository.

| File                                     | Loaded                  | What it does                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CLAUDE.md`                              | always                  | Behavioural guidelines: state assumptions before coding, keep it simple, make surgical changes, define success criteria and verify.                                  |
| `.claude/rules/python.md`                | when touching `**/*.py` | Python rules with a bad and a good example each — raise instead of print, name constants, bound anything that grows, catch specific exceptions, and so on.           |
| `.claude/skills/ai-code-review/SKILL.md` | on request              | A review pass over AI-generated code: correctness, error handling, tests, quality and performance, security. Reports findings by severity and ends with a checklist. |

`calculator.py` is written to follow the Python rules, which is why it raises `ValueError` instead of printing, uses named constants, and keeps history in a bounded `deque`.

## Installing Python

The project needs Python 3.6 or newer. Check what you have:

```bash
# Mac/Linux
python3 --version

# Windows
python --version
```

If that fails, install it. macOS ships no usable Python by default — `python3` is a stub that offers to install the Command Line Tools. Most Linux distributions already include it. On Windows, tick **Add Python to PATH** in the python.org installer.

```bash
# Mac
xcode-select --install       # Apple's Command Line Tools
brew install python          # or Homebrew, for a newer version

# Linux
sudo apt install python3     # Debian, Ubuntu
sudo dnf install python3     # Fedora

# Windows
Download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ or the Microsoft Store
```

## Running the app

```bash
# Mac/Linux
python3 calculator.py

# Windows
python calculator.py
```

Example session:

```
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Power
6. Square root
7. Percentage
h. History   q. Quit
Choose: 1
First number: 2
Second number: 3
Result: 5.0
```

## Running the tests

The suite is `test_calculator.py`, written with the standard-library `unittest` module. Fourteen tests cover the arithmetic operations and every `ValueError` guard.

```bash
# Mac/Linux
python3 test_calculator.py

# Windows
python test_calculator.py
```

Expected output:

```
Ran 14 tests in 0.000s

OK
```
